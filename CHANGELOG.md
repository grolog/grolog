Third commit

12.11.18 third version
you can add a nutrient company and add a nutrient through the admin panel. you can not yet add the nutrient to the plant list yet. that is next. this update is to show the project is still moving, even if it is slow. this is a one person project at this time. any help welcomed.

error handling not done yet, security is not of concern as you should not allow anyone besides localhost to use this system at this time.
